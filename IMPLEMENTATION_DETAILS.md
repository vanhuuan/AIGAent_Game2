  - Add more complex event type detection
  - Implement historical event tracking
  - Add reinforcement learning for event response optimization

## Utils Package

### `utils/pathfinding.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides algorithms for navigation and resource discovery.
- **Implementation**: Contains functions for finding paths to positions or resources.
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used in `shortest_path` and `shortest_path_to_value` to find optimal paths.
  - **Adjacency Search**: Used in `find_adjacent_resources` to discover resources near the player.
- **Missing/TODO**:
  - Implement A* algorithm for more efficient pathfinding
  - Add dynamic obstacle avoidance
  - Optimize for large map exploration

## Key Algorithms Explained

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Pathfinding
The client uses BFS to find the shortest path to a target position or resource:

1. Start from the player's current position
2. Explore in all four directions (up, down, left, right)
3. For each position, check if it's valid (within bounds and traversable)
4. Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles
5. When the target is found, return the path

BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph, making it suitable for grid-based navigation where each move has equal cost.

### Resource Discovery
The client uses a 5x5 grid around the player to discover resources:

1. Scan a 5×5 area centered on the player
2. For each cell, check if it contains a resource
3. If a resource is found, add its position to the entity_positions dictionary
4. Special handling for items like swords and armor to ensure they're collected only once

### Decision Making Logic
The agent uses a priority-based decision making process:

1. First priority: Process server events (going home or collecting rewards)
2. Second priority: Collect swords and armor if available
3. Third priority: Collect wood if needed
4. Fourth priority: Collect cotton if needed
5. Default: Explore for new resources

### Event Handling System
The event handling system processes server messages using the following approach:

1. Detect and queue new server messages
2. Pass messages to the EventHandlerAgent for analysis
3. Determine the required action based on the event analysis:
   - If an emergency (should_go_home = true), go home immediately
   - If a reward is available, navigate to the reward position
4. Resume normal operations after event handling
5. Track event status until completion

## Critical Missing Components

1. **Enhanced Combat Strategy**: While the code tracks swords and armor, it lacks sophisticated combat strategies for player interactions.

2. **Adaptive Resource Collection**: The current implementation has fixed priorities but could benefit from dynamic prioritization based on current needs and proximity.

3. **Error Recovery**: The system needs better mechanisms to recover from failures, network issues, or unexpected game states.

4. **Performance Optimization**: For larger maps or longer gameplay, the pathfinding and exploration algorithms could be optimized further.

5. **Testing Framework**: A comprehensive testing framework would help ensure the client behaves correctly in various scenarios.
